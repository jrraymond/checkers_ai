to do:
work on an agent generator
define how imput/output nodes work and interact with the nework
write system to store and evolve agents in a genetic fashion
	how to meld networks together 
	how to select important parts of the network to blend
	can we store agents in some sort of network database?
develop system to select agents and have them compete





notes/thoughts:
1. can we write a system to define sub-networks to evolve with relative indpendance?  

2. akin to 1, can we make evolution somewhat modular?
